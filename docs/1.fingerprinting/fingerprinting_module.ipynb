    "# Fingerprinting analysis - Matrix-like data\n",

    "How do you use the fingerprinting module of `sihnpy`?\n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrate a typical **fingerprinting** analysis using `sihnpy`. You can run these analyses by building a script like we do below in a Python script or in a Jupyter Notebook. In the case where you need to run this analysis on a high number of participants or on very high dimensional data (>160,000 features per participants), I recommend using a command-line script (ADD THE REF TO THE NOTEBOOK HERE).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the steps above are specific to the matrix-like data (e.g., functional or structural connectivity, covariance matrix, etc.). If you have table-like data (e.g., volume by region), a different method is required. (ADD REF TO THE NOTEBOOK HERE).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Preparing the data\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a fingerprinting analysis, we need three things:\n",
    "* The path to a list of participants to analyze\n",
    "* The path to the folder containing the matrices of the first session of brain imaging\n",
    "* The path to the folder containing the matrices of the second session brain imaging\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have the above for your data, you can skip ahead to 2. Otherwise, `sihnpy` also offers a small sample of data simulated using `numpy` and `pandas` to practice using the functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the simulated data for fingerprinting, you can run the following code:"
