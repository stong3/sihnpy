    "# Fingerprinting analysis - Matrix-like data: Step-by-step\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, it's all great to know about the rationale and everything behind fingerprinting, but now let's get to the fun part of it: how do we actually use the module?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I demonstrate, step-by-step, how to run the fingerprinting analysis. You can follow along once you have installed `sihnpy` and opened a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Note that currently the fingerprinting module will only work with matrix-like data, as is common for functional or structural connectivity. A future release of `sihnpy` will also include a way to do fingerprinting when you have tabular data.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that the fingerprinting module, for now, only supports data in matrix-like format. Specifically, it accepts two paths containing matrices that you want to fingerprint together. A future release of `sihnpy` will also include a way to do fingerprinting when you have tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Already read the tutorial before and you just want the code (a.k.a. too long; didn't read)? Head on out to the {ref}`tl;dr section <1.fingerprinting/fingerprinting_module:tl;dr>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Preparing the data\n",
    "\n",
    "To run a fingerprinting module for matrix-like data, we need three things:\n",
    "* The path to a list of participants to analyze\n",
    "* The path to the folder containing the matrices of the first session of brain imaging\n",
    "* The path to the folder containing the matrices of the second session brain imaging\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have the above for your data, you can skip ahead to {ref}`the next section <1.fingerprinting/fingerprinting_module:2. Importing the data for fingerprinting>`. Otherwise, `sihnpy` also offers a small subset of data from the Prevent-AD cohort. Remember that by using the Prevent-AD data to practice to use the code, [you agree to the terms of use](../license.md). You can access the data using the code below:"

    "However, this method does come with the drawback that you need to make sure the nodes in the matrix are indeed organized in the order you are expecting and you need to make sure that the nodes you are selecting are the right ones. The script won't be able to tell you whether you selected the nodes correctly or not.\n",

    "**Selecting between-network edges**\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the literature before our paper[^St_Onge_2023] usually focused on using within-network edges in the matrices to do functional connectivity. But within-network edges only represent a small portion of edges; between-network edges (i.e., connections between different networks) are more numerous.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our results, we found that fingerprinting using these edges works even better than within-network edges. And you can test that out for yourself too using the `nodes_between_index` argument in `fingerprint_mats`! But how do we select between-network edges? First, a quick, very simplified illustration of within- and between-network edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{image} ../images/between_network.png\n",
    ":align: center\n",
    ":scale: 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, we imagine three brain networks: the visual, the default mode (DMN) and the frontoparietal (FP) networks, each containing a single node (i.e., 1 row per network). This is a very much simplified example, but really just to illustrate the idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each square in the matrix is representing an edge (i.e., a link between two nodes). When I write about **within-network** edges, I refer to the blue squares. For example, the first blue square at the top left corner represents **the link within the visual network nodes**. However, if I want to talk about **between-network** edges, I mean all the other colored squares that **aren't blue**. For instance, the between-network edges between the visual network and the default-mode and frontoparietal networks are illustrated in orange, in the top row. It represents the **link between the visual and the two other networks**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you understand that, it becomes easy to adapt it in `sihnpy` for your own needs: `sihnpy` simply needs to know what are the indices of the **rows** (`nodes_within_index`) of the matrix we want and the indices of the **columns** we need (`nodes_between_index`). \n",
    "\n",
    "When we give `sihnpy` only the `nodes_within_index` argument, it assumes that we want the same rows and columns (i.e., within-network), and that the sub-matrix we are selecting is symmetric. In `numpy` notation, this is equivalent to `matrix[nodes_within_index][:,nodes_within_index]`. In our toy example, it would grab only the blue squares. However, in a real life example, with connectivity data, it will discard the diagonal and the lower triangle before computing the fingerprinting.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if we give the `nodes_between_index` argument, `sihnpy` will grab the specific sub-matrix we specify. In `numpy` notation, the two arguments I mention roughly translate to `matrix[nodes_within_index][:,nodes_between_index]`. In our toy example, this should only grab the orange square if we are interested in the visual network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this application of the method allows for a lot of flexibility, because you can select virtually any between-network edges you want. For instance, you could specifically request edges between the visual and default-mode network only to do the fingerprinting.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "With great flexibility comes great danger.\n",
    "\n",
    "`sihnpy` won't be able to tell you whether the nodes you selected are the right ones. So if you forget a node or include a node that shouldn't have been included, `sihnpy` will still proceed ahead and it will affect your results. This is further complicated by the 0-indexed Python notation (i.e., the \"5th\" column is actually index 4), which means that human error is also likely, particularly for those not used to Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using between-network edges, `sihnpy` also doesn't remove duplicated edges. This is because, technically, there shouldn't be any duplicated edges since we aren't looking at within-network edges. If your indices for rows (`nodes_within_index`) and for columns (`nodes_between_index`) overlap, you will include duplicate edges in your analysis, which will affect your results.\n",
