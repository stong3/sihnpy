# Sliding-window module

Welcome to the section on the **sliding-window**! You will find a detailed description of the rationale behind this method and detailed instructions on how you can use it on your own.

```{warning}
Note that `sihnpy` provides data to practice using the **sliding-window** module. While the PREVENT-AD participants are used, the data available for this method **is simulated data** (i.e., the numbers observed are fake; they were randomly generated to fit the purpose of the tutorials). As a general rule for `sihnpy`, and especially for this module, **only use the data provided to help you practice using the module, not to conduct or publish actual research**.
