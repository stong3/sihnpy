    "## Practice data\n",
    "\n",
    "In other `sihnpy` modules, real data from a subset of the PREVENT-AD Open Dataset is used. While we could probably use the continuous handedness scale to create windows, there is not a lot of diversity in the numbers (so a lot of participants that are fully right-handed would be clumped together in most windows). \n",
    "\n",
    "A variable that usually lends itself well to the sliding-window approach is age. Age is not available in the PREVENT-AD Open Dataset as it is a restricted information. Instead, I opted to **simulate age data** for the PREVENT-AD participants; similarly to {ref}`the data available for the Spatial Extent <2.spex/spex_details:Creating Gaussian simulated data>`. I will actually refer you to that section for more detailed information on how the age data was simulated in the PREVENT-AD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just know that the simulated age data matches the [mean, standard deviation and inclusion criteria from the PREVENT-AD](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2021.102733): mean age of 65 years, standard deviation of 5 years and minimum age to be included is 55 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "Just like for the spatial extent module, `sihnpy` provides practice data to use the sliding-window module. While PREVENT-AD participants are used, the data is **simulated**. As a general rule for `sihnpy`, and especially for this module, **only use the data provided to help you practice using the module, not to conduct or publish actual research**.\n",

    "In other words, the formula substracts the window size from the total number of participants, and divides the result by the step size. Because the numbers we choose can result in divisions with remainders, we force a **ceiling** rounding (rounding up) as we can't have fractions of windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also where the `collapse` argument comes into play. As the parameters we choose for the windows will almost never fall on a number of windows where the participants in each window all have the same number, `sihnpy` proposes to the user to choose how to deal with this.\n",

You could easily compute this for each dataframe, but it kind of is a pain. Thankfully, I am quite a lazy programmer and I didn't want to have to do that every time, so I integrated a function that does this in `sihnpy`. You just need to feed it the dictionary we just computed as well as the name of the variable you want an statistics on."
