    "Many of currently used statistical analyses rely on the assumption that **brains of similar individuals are relatively homogenous**; meaning that individuals can be grouped together in relative confidence.\n",

    "However, many studies, mainly in the field of functional magnetic resonance imaging **(REF MUELLER/REFS FP)**, have now highlighted that individuals in groups thought to be homogenous show significant within-group differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what prompted the development of the original fingerprinting methodology by [Finn et al. (2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4135). Fingerprinting aims to derive brain signatures unique to each individuals, by (FINISH EXPLAINING) + ADD FIGURE HERE\n"
