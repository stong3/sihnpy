    "Many of currently used statistical analyses rely on the assumption that **brains of similar individuals are relatively homogenous**; meaning that individuals can be grouped together in relative confidence.\n",

    "Fingerprinting methodology was originally developped by [Finn et al. (2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4135) as a way to identify individuals based on the idea that each person has a unique pattern of functional connectivity preserved across tasks and time. These fingerprints were then associated with various measures (cognition **(REF)**, brain volume **(REF)**, etc.)\n"
